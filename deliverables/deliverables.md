# Project Title - CookEase
## Group Number - 3
### Group members
- Su Wai Phyoe
- Liu Lu
- Luo Ying
- Chen Yicheng

### Target users
- Foreigners living in or visiting Finland: looking for familiar or interesting recipes and local ingredient sources

- Finnish users: Interested in exploring and cooking international cuisine at home

### Stakeholders
- Local supermarkets & food brands: potential partners via ingredient link integration

Our project is a recipe-sharing website designed to help international students and newcomers in Finland connect with the taste of home while adapting to local life. Moving to a new country often brings challenges, and one of the most personal challenges is food. Many people miss the familiar dishes from their culture but struggle to find the right ingredients or recipes abroad.

To address this, our platform allows users to browse recipes from their home countries. Each recipe includes detailed cooking steps and a list of required ingredients. To make the experience practical and user-friendly, the ingredients are linked directly to Finnish supermarketsâ€™ online stores. This helps users quickly identify where they can purchase specific items locally, ensuring that preparing home-style meals becomes easier and more accessible.

In addition to reconnecting people with their own culture, our website fosters cultural exchange by making international recipes visible and approachable to everyone. This way, it not only supports smoother integration into Finnish society but also encourages cross-cultural understanding through food.

We are using Trello to manage our Product Backlog. Our board is organized with lists that represent different stages of development (To Do, Doing, Done) and we use labels to prioritize features (e.g., High Priority, Medium Priority, Low Priority).
